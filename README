Razor-qt
========

Razor-qt is an advanced, easy-to-use, and fast desktop environment based on Qt
technologies. It has been tailored for users who value simplicity, speed, and an
intuitive interface. Unlike most desktop environments, Razor-qt also works fine
with weak machines.

While still a new project, Razor-qt already contains the key DE components:

    Panel
    Desktop
    Application launcher
    Settings center
    Notifications
    Sessions

You can use either all of them or part of them. Razor-qt works with various WMs,
most of Razor developers use Openbox. But it's no problem to take any modern WM
from fwwm2 to kwin (yes, KDE without Plasma Desktop is possible too).

Razor-qt is a new open-source project and you can help us improve it. We welcome
your bug reports and suggestions; you are free to translate all into your own
language, create more attractive graphics, anything.

For component-specific information, see README files in their respective
subdirectories.
